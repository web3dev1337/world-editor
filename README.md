All merged pull requests will deploy to https://build.hytopia.com for the greater community to use.

## Get Paid To Add Features And Fix Bugs! (OFFICIAL PAID BOUNTY SYSTEM)
Bounties are requests for bug fixes, refactors, or feature additions that meet certain criteria and are submitted as a pull request. The HYTOPIA team will review your PR relative to the bounty you're submitting it for, and if your PR is accepted, the designated bounty for the request will be awarded.

Additionally! If you have found a bug, issue with the world editor, or believe a specific feature would be valuable, you can [submit it via a Github issue here](https://github.com/hytopiagg/world-editor/issues). 

If your issue, request or bug is escalated by our team to become a bounty, you will be included in the official bounty issue, and receive 10% of the total bounty amount after you or another developer submits a pull request we deem acceptable to fulfill the bounty. That means, if a bounty is escalated and has a $500 reward, you as the submitter would receive $50, the developer whos PR is accepted for the bounty would receive $500. 

[You can find a list of available bug, feature and refactor bounties that will be paid to the first participant to submit an accepted PR here](https://github.com/hytopiagg/world-editor/labels/BOUNTY)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
